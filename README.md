# About
Literally just a single `package.json` published on github and visual studio marketplace in the needlessly complicated way Microsoft could think of in order to sell you azure cloud servers and bad UI...

# Why did I build this?
Well initially it was just a simple place to put all the great, amazing extensions in one place for the team as a whole to evaluate collaborative, test out and decide where else to go from there during [Auth0's hackathon]() and the following main project... 

Easily could have and should have been done by friday morning at 10am had everyone met and knocked it out.

Also I honestly thought publishing a simple json file would take less time then it did the first time around...

Boy was I wrong about that... I love going down a rabbit hole of documentation designed to tell me how great azure is, why I should sign up for it, forcing me to sign up for it and then still failing. Don't we all love tutorials like that? Hell, it's not even published the same way as the last one was last time...

Your documentation is literal maze of confusion and errors and needless steps...


# What Extensions are here:
I could list them all here and describe why I wanted to use them but honestly just do it. Make your security team flip the hell and just yolo it all.
